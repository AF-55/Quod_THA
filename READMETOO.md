### Answers : Sales forecast and analysis

I used Pandas to quickly and efficiently process tabular data. With this library, dataframe manipulation is very easy and makes database management with Python very complete (implying no particular need for SQL).

Answers to each question have been saved as CSV files (from Pandas) and plots made with Matplotlib.

For non model-related questions, Pandas was enough to give a proper answer.

For model training, I opted for an LSTM model coded with PyTorch. This kind of model seems the most appropriate because of its ability to capture temporal patterns, handle long-term dependencies and deal with irregular data. The model has also been saved and the corresponding python file can easily be modified in order to choose whether or not we want to retrain a model.

Hoping that you are satisfied with my job,
